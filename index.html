            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>Computer science was not my original plan coming out of high school. I enrolled in the astrophysics program, but found that I was enjoying coding programs for my assignments
            more than the rest of the physics work. As you might be able to tell I am fascinated with space and science fiction. </p>

            <p>I have also been someone who enjoys music all my life. I learned to play the guitar when I was 7 and have been adding instruments to my repertoire ever since. My most recent musical endeavour
            has been into synthesis and sound design, and one day I hope to develop my own synthesizer.</p>

            <p>As for my less productive hobbies, like many computer enthusiasts I love playing video games. I commonly look for new strategy games, but will try anything if I see enough praise for it.
            some of my all time favourites are (in no particular order):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Factorio</li>
                <li>Dota 2</li>
                <li>Subnautica</li>
                <li>Outer Wilds (not Outer Worlds)</li>
                <li>Terraria</li>
            </ul>
